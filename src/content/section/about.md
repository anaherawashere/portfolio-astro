Kia ora! 👋 I’m Anahera, a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in strategy, digital fundraising, and leading impactful campaigns.

After years of developing creative solutions in the fundraising space, I made the leap into web development. I’m passionate about bringing ideas to life through code, and I’ve been sharpening my skills in front-end and back-end development. Whether it’s building user-friendly websites or designing efficient APIs, I’m always looking for ways to solve problems and create meaningful digital experiences.

I’ve worked alongside charities such as SPCA NZ, Cancer Society NZ, Breast Cancer Foundation NZ and Starlight Children's Hospital to drive significant growth through innovative digital strategies. Now, I’m eager to apply that same creativity and strategic mindset to tech, delivering value through clean, well-structured code.

Outside of coding, I’m passionate about making communities more inclusive, accessible, and safe for young people. When I’m not working, I’m probably tending to my plants or searching for my new fave second-hand furniture 🌱🛋️
