role: Digital Fundraising and Events Manager
company: SPCA New Zealand
description: I transformed the SPCA's 20-year-old calendar competition into 'SPCA Pets of the Year,' a virtual peer-to-peer fundraising event. By its second year, we increased income by 53% and grew participant acquisition by 480%. I led a team delivering revenue through peer-to-peer events, matched giving days, and DIY fundraising. I developed digital and community fundraising strategies that increased overall income by 10% and created new digital income streams. Additionally, I designed event websites on Raisely, optimising UI/UX and improving the sign-up and donation journey, while tracking performance and evaluating campaign outcomes.
