description: This full immersion web development boot camp covered a modern web dev stack, including Typescript, React, Node.js, Express, and Back and Frontend testing. I built web applications through hands-on challenges both individually and with partners. In weekly projects simulating a real-life development team, we learned how to plan, structure and develop an application as a group. The course's Human Skills component challenged me to explore different communication styles, exchange feedback, and address difficult interpersonal situations.
