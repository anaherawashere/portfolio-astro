  <p>
    Kia ora! 👋 I’m Anahera, a Full Stack Web Developer with a background in
    strategy, digital fundraising, and leading impactful campaigns.
  </p>
  <p>
    After years of developing creative solutions in the fundraising space, I
    made the leap into web development. I’m passionate about bringing ideas to
    life through code, and I’ve been sharpening my skills in front-end and
    back-end development. Whether it’s building user-friendly websites or
    designing efficient APIs, I’m always looking for ways to solve problems and
    create meaningful digital experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve worked alongside charities such as SPCA NZ, Cancer Society NZ, Breast
    Cancer Foundation NZ and Starlight Children's Hospital to drive significant
    growth through innovative digital strategies. Now, I’m eager to apply that
    same creativity and strategic mindset to tech, delivering value through
    clean, well-structured code.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of coding, I’m passionate about making communities more inclusive,
    accessible, and safe for young people. When I’m not working, I’m probably
    tending to my plants or searching for my new fave second-hand furniture 🌱🛋️
